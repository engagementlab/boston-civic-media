            <div class="entry">
				<p>Thank you for purchasing our product! We are very glad that you have decided on our Philanthropy WordPress theme. </p>
				<p>This documentation will teach you how to set up and use the <b>Philanthropy</b> wp theme. The theme is very easy to use and we are here to guide and help you, so please read and follow the documentation and if you have further questions visit our AfterCare Support Forum. This documentation is more of a reference work if you do not know what to do, or if you are not familiar to WordPress.</p>
				<p><b>Philanthropy</b> WordPress is a complex and customizable wp theme. It comes with an unique, massive and functional backend CMS, that gives you almost unending possibilities of making changes for your needs. Every page, post or category template has own set of options that allow you to customize page.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Some pointers from ThemeFuse</h3>
				<p>Please read the following documentation very carefully as it will help you set the theme up with little-to-no frustration. The <b>Philanthropy</b> WordPress theme has been tested on all major browsers and latest version of WordPress. We have gone through the setup process multiple times and provided the best possible instructions.</p>
				<p>We strongly recommend you to use a fresh install of WordPress and integrate your content into the pages according to the documentation. Of course, you can try to implement the theme into your current WordPress, but we will not provide in-depth support for it. The theme has specific settings that may conflict with your current setup of categories, plugins, javascript use, and more.</p>
				<p>We believe that most options and tools designed for this theme won’t make you any problems, will be very easy in use and you won’t need any additional help. But, if any problem will occur, this documentation file should help you to find the right solution. And if this documentation won’t help you, feel free to <a target="_blank" href="http://themefuse.com/#contact-us">contact us</a> and write some questions in our <a target="_blank" href="http://support.themefuse.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">ThemeFuse AfterCare Support Forum</a>. We will try to help you as soon as possible, and as good as we can. We will be also very grateful for reporting any errors if you will find any – everything should work great, but some issues that we are not aware of may occur, especially in first releases of this complex theme.</p>
				<p>We wish you good luck in your work with <b>Philanthropy</b>, and of course we would love to see your website and what you come up with by using this theme.</p>
				<p><strong>Best regards!</strong><br>

            <h2 class="left-details-h2">How to install WordPress</h2>
            <div class="entry">
				<p><a style="display:none" rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://vimeo.com/16919411" title="How to install WordPress" class="video-tutorial-button" savefrom_lm_index="1" savefrom_lm="1"></a><br>
				This is a short walkthrough of WordPress installation. This part will be useful if you install WordPress theme for the first time.</p>
				<p>Before you start, you must have a server that supports PHP and provide access to a MySQL database. First step is to install WordPress on your server. You must download WordPress ZIP file from <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">http://wordpress.org/download/</a>, extract the files and you’ll get a folder named wordpress. Now you must upload all files from this folder to your server via FTP client. Content from this folder must be located in the root of the website, so that this location will be the URL of your website.</p>
				<p>If you will access your site URL now, you should see only a note: “There doesn’t seem to be a wp-config.php file…”.</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/create-configuration-file.png"><span style="display: inline;"></span><img src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/create-configuration-file.png" alt="" title="" width="520" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-533"></a>
				</p>
				<p>In next step you must manually create a configuration file. Open the wordpress folder and make a copy of file named <strong>wp-config-sample.php</strong>. Change name of this copy to <strong>wp-config.php</strong> and open this file in an editor, it can be a simple editor like Notepad. Now you must modify this file and add information about your database. You need to have four data pieces to do this:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>- &nbsp;Address of database server</strong> – for example: <code>mysql.yourdomain.com</code></li>
				<li><strong>- &nbsp;Server username</strong> – for example: <code>yourusername</code></li>
				<li><strong>- &nbsp;Server password</strong> – for example: <code>123456789</code></li>
				<li><strong>- &nbsp;Database name</strong> – for example: <code>wpdbname</code></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You must fill these four data pieces into your wp-config.php file. This is how it would look like for our example data:</p>
				<p><code> /** The name of the database for WordPress */<br>
				define(‘DB_NAME’, ‘wpdbname’);<br>
				/** MySQL database username */<br>
				define(‘DB_USER’, ‘username’);<br>
				/** MySQL database password */<br>
				define(‘DB_PASSWORD’, ‘123456789’);<br>
				/** MySQL hostname */<br>
				define(‘DB_HOST’, ‘mysql.yourdomain.com’);</code></p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wordpress-database-conection.png"><span></span><img src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wordpress-database-conection.png" alt="" title="wordpress-database-conection" width="520" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550"></a>
				</p>
				<p>Now go back to browser and re-load your site that is pointing to your WordPress installation. If all the data from wp-config.php file is correct you will see the installation page:</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/login-wordpress-data.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-109" title="install-wordpress" src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/login-wordpress-data.png" alt="" width="520"></a>
				</p>
				<p>Just fill in the name of your blog and your email address, and click on Install WordPress button (this data can be changed later). Now you will see the last page of WordPress installation process that shows the default Username, which is always admin, and a randomly generated Password.</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/succes-wordpress-installed.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/succes-wordpress-installed.png" alt="" width="520"></a>
				</p>
				<p>You must remember this password or just copy and paste it to a temporary file. After this click on Log In button or enter admin panel by pointing to your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin. You will be redirected to admin panel login page where you have to enter default Username and randomly generated password. You can change Username and Password when you are logged into admin panel. Just click on Username (admin) in the top right corner of admin panel. And that’s it, now you can install your theme to your WordPress installation. And that’s it, now you can install&nbsp;<b>Philanthropy</b> theme to your WordPress installation.</p>
				<p>You can either choose to upload the theme to your server via FTP (only upload the unzipped folder „Philanthropy“ into the folder wp-content/themes/ ) or via wordpress upload function. To use the upload function zip the “Philanthropy” folder and then upload it via wordpress admin panel. (notice: if you are new to wordpress and have problems installing it you might want to check out this link: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress</a> ). After this you must login to admin panel (or refresh this panel if you are still logged), go to Themes (under <b>Appearance</b>, on the left WordPress menu) and activate <b>Philanthropy</b> theme.</p>

				<p><br />
				After installing a fresh WordPress and activating our wp theme you can use the cool feature that we keep bragging about: <strong>1 click auto install.</strong> You find this feature on the left hand side under the <strong>Fuse Framework</strong> button. </p>
				<p>This 1 click auto install feature is developed by us in order to help you understand how our wp theme is working. You won’t have to set everything step by step like you do with most  of the wp themes. </p>
				<p>By pressing the <strong>Import Demo Version</strong> button, the wp theme auto populates categories, posts, pages, widgets and FuseFramework options. It’s much easier now to understand how the theme works and all you need to do is, edit the sample posts, categories, pages and place your own. You do not need technical knowledge. Also you can <strong>Skip Import</strong> and populate theme manually if you are confident on your WordPress skills.</p>

			<div id="create-manage-sidebars" class="separator"></div>

            <h2 class="left-details-h2">Create &amp; manage sidebars</h2>
            <div class="entry">
				<p><b>Philanthropy</b> theme is widget ready and comes with complex sidebar. It is possible to create an unlimited number of sidebars and use unique sidebar for every category or page template. It is also possible to define one default sidebar that will automatically work for all pages. Every custom widget has own set of options and can be very easy customized. </p>
				<p>To create a page sidebar go to <b>Manage Sidebars Tab</b> and click on which page you want to add sidebars. Edit widgets and save option page. </p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="tf/images/3.png"><span style="display: inline;"></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="tf/images/3.png" alt="" width="520"></a>
				</p>
				<p>On the right side of <i>Available Widgets</i> section you will see all created sidebar. Now simply drag and drop widgets from <i>Available Widgets</i> section to sidebar on the right. When widget is placed on sidebar you can use options from this widget and customize sidebar for your needs.</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="tf/images/4.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="tf/images/4.png" alt="" width="520"></a>
				</p>
				<p>After sidebar is assigned to page or category you will see all widgets placed on this sidebar. In some cases sidebar is not visible – this refers only a situation when there is no place for sidebar created.</p>
				<p><b>Note:</b> Be very careful when removing widget areas that already got widgets applied to them. WordPress doesn’t remember where it stored widgets by name, it stores this information by number. So if I would add a Google Map widget to Contact (Nr7 Sidebar Page – contact), and then delete the content widget area the widgets (ex. Google Map ) would then be in PORTFOLIO. (previously in Nr8 Sidebar Category – PORTFOLIO, now will be Nr7) </p>

				</p>
				<p></p>

				<p>The second option is to edit your header.php file directly. Search for the tfuse_logo value and change the picture.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Changing your Favicon</h3>
				<p>This URL path is for favicon image. Favicon is a small 16×16 pixels image that is displayed in browser as icon of your site. This image should be saved in ICO format.</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">
				<a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/favicon2.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/favicon2.png" alt="" width="520"></a><br>

				<p></p>
				<h3>Setup Custom CSS</h3>
				<p>Quickly add some CSS to your theme by adding it to this block.</p>
				<p class="screensdocs">

            <div id="dynamic-images" class="separator"></div>

            <h2 class="left-details-h2">Dynamic Images</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <p><a style="display:none" title="Dynamic Images" href="http://vimeo.com/16919381" rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" class="video-tutorial-button withtitle"></a></p>
                <h3>Image Resizing</h3>
                <p>Next step is to decide whether you want to use automatic image resizing or not. If this option is activated you only need to upload one pic for each portfolio entry or one pic for each slider entry. Otherwhise you need to add small preview pictures for the portfolio as well.</p>
                <p>If you do want to use the image resizing script you need a server with php5 and GD-Library installed (a module for image operations)</p>
                <p>If you dont know what this means never mind, most servers come with this preinstalled.</p>
                <p class="screensdocs">
                    <a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/enable-dynamic-images.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/enable-dynamic-images.png" alt="" width="520"></a>
                </p>
                <p>If GD library is installed and the cache folder is writeable you will see this options to choose from:</p>
                <p>If the GD library is not installed you will see an error message, as well as if the cache folder is not writeable. If you want to use the script for automatic image resizing you have to do another thing after setup: you have to set the permissions of the folder „cache“ in your theme folder to write able (777). </p>
                <p>This is only necessary if you want to use the image resizing script. </p>
                <p>If you do not know how to set the permission please google it, every ftp program has a slightly different approach. I would recommend googeling for „set chmod to 777 with „your-ftp-programm (eg dreamweaver)“</p>
                <p class="screensdocs">
                    <a rel="prettyPhoto[screensdocs]" href="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/file-permision.png"><span></span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-110" title="" src="http://themefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/file-permision.png" alt=""></a>
                </p>
                <p>If you need support for the resizing script which is called thumb.php you can take a look here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/</a></p>

            <div id="page-404" class="separator"></div>

            <h2 class="left-details-h2">Page 404</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <p>A special Page 404 is used in situation when <strong>WordPress</strong> cannot find a particular page. This page should work fine by default – <strong>WordPress</strong> should automatically look for the 404.php web page when page from selected address doesn’t exist. But sometimes this could not work properly because web server can encounter a problem before WordPress is aware of it. To resolve this, you will have to configure your web server for custom 404 error handling. This will guarantee that your web server sends the visitor to your 404.php page template.</p>
                <p>You must set your web server to use your custom error files. For this you need to edit the .htaccess file in the main directory (root of your site, where index.php file is located) of your WordPress installation. If you don’t have an .htaccess file, you must create it. To create a .htaccess file you can just create a new TXT file and change its name to .htaccess (no name plus .htaccess file extension).</p>
                <p>Now you must just edit .htaccess file and add the following line:</p>
                <p><code>ErrorDocument 404 /index.php?error=404</code></p>
                <p>This will ensure that the server finds your 404 page.</p>
                <p>The URL /index.php is server root-relative (the forward slash begins with the root folder of your site). This means that you must put here a full URL path. For example, if your site is located in a subfolder or subdirectory of your site’s root folder named ‘foldername’, the line you add to your .htaccess file should be:</p>
                <p><code>ErrorDocument 404 /foldername/index.php?error=404</code></p>

				<h3>How to create a wordpress category</h3>
				<p>In our <b>Framework</b> a part of site content is produced via categories. To create a category you must click on Posts -&gt; Categories option (on WordPress menu). First you should enter a <strong>Category Name</strong> for this category right at the top (this will be also used as title for your categories). For every category you must also select a <strong>Parent</strong> in <strong>Category Parent</strong> section. If it is needed you can also add a description for this category in <strong>Description section</strong>. Now you can start to add option for created category.</p>
				<p><strong>Framework Category</strong> have other fields than a standart wordpress category.</p>

				<p>In WordPress themes, the most part of site content is produced via post pages. To create a post page you must click on Posts option (on WordPress menu). Click on <strong>Add New</strong> button and you can start to create your post page. First you should enter a title name for this post right at the top. For every post you must also select a category in <strong>Category </strong>section on the right side. If it is needed you can also create a category in this section – this is necessary when you start working with this theme because <strong>Category </strong>list is empty. Now you can start to put content for created post.</p>
				<p>No matter if this is a blog, portfolio or services post, for every post you can use image resize or must create three images – one main image and two thumbnail images (medium and small thumb). Main image is used as big main post image and is displayed for example: for posts on main Blog page. To add one of these post images you must insert an URL path in edit box, right below preview image in post options.</p>

Don’t forget to set the <strong>Email to</strong> field <strong>(Number 4)</strong>, this is where the message will be sent (make sure you monitor this email). You can use this module to create how many contact forms you like, make certain fields mandatory or not, and more. After the form is created you can copy its shortcode <b>(Number 2)</b> and insert it in any page or post. </p>

                    When a client submits the form above, <strong>3 things</strong> happen: <strong>1.</strong> the admin will receive an email that a new reservation was made (see Message Settings to change the email template), <strong>2.</strong> the client will receive an email that the reservation is registered in the system (see Message Settings to change the email template) and <strong>3.</strong> the reservation is added with a Pending status in the WordPress admin under <b>User Reservations (Number 1)</b>.</p>

                    By selecting one of the Pending reservations you can check out the info submitted by the client as shown in the image below. From here you can Approve or Reject a reservation.

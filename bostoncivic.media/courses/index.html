				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This course serves as an introduction to contemporary and emergent design practice, by investigating the expanded role of design in the public realm, the agency of designers working with(in) communities, and the utility of design-thinking as a tool for social change. Students will learn in both lecture and project-based formats, and will be responsible for working cooperatively and collaboratively in teams on group projects. Students will engage in learning by doing, and they will be required to document, reflect, and analyze their work intermittently over the course of the semester and at the end of the semester through a formal Practice Assessment. Community Practice also provides an introduction to the Practice Department and the pedagogies of applied learning at the BAC.

				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>Students will refine and broaden their ability to interpret scientific language and communicate critical scientific content to others. This course will examine popular representations of environmental issues in various outlets such as film, fiction, and journalism. Conversation about any scientific inaccuracies will provide a motivation for delving deeper into the science and discussion of creative intent will provide a mechanism for discussing ethical, social, and political impact of related research. Students will then apply such interpretative understandings to their own craft as they put scientific translation and communication into practice in select scenarios.</p>

				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>After years of inadequate government action against escalating climate change, activists have turned to creative strategies to educate the public, agitate for policy change, propose alternative ways of living, and transform the environmental imaginary. In this studio-seminar, you will “learn by doing,” collaboratively designing a civic media/activist art project around fossil fuel divestment while critically exploring a broad range of creative responses to ecological crisis. No prior experience in the arts is required; the studio is organized into multidisciplinary, diverse teams that work together to create projects and to inquire into the history, theory, best practices, and critiques of community inclusion and environmental politics in art and design.</p>

					<h2>Instructor</h2>Catherine D&#x27;Ignazio  (<a href="mailto:catherine_dignazio@emerson.edu">catherine_dignazio@emerson.edu</a>) 
				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This course introduces concepts, methods and practices of data visualization and data storytelling for journalism and civic media graduate students. Data journalism is an emerging field of practice that ranges from the dazzling interactive graphics of the New York Times to the consistent, watchful reporting of sites like Homicide Watch. In this course, students learn to adopt a &quot;data-mindset&quot; and reflect on how telling stories with data can help advance (and occasionally obscure) public understanding. Students will learn how to find and create data sets for their stories, how to analyze data (including some basic scripting and coding) and how to present data in a variety of ways. We will also discuss privacy, verification, ethics and some of the other thorny issues that arise with data reporting. Some experience in HTML and coding is helpful but not required.</p>

					<h2>Instructor</h2>Doris Sommer 
				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>The lecture series addresses how change and growth in global health can stem from an aesthetic approach to its technical and social challenges. Theoretical readings (Plato, Kant, Schiller, Dewey, Freire, Gramsci, Rancière, Mockus, Boal, Nussbaum, inter alia) are grounded in concrete cases of health care. The final project will be a design for a creative intervention. A companion essay will trace the development of the design and reference theoretical texts and cases.</p>

					<h2>Instructor</h2>Sharon Harlan  (<a href="mailto:s.harlan@northeastern.edu">s.harlan@northeastern.edu</a>) 
				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This interdisciplinary course relates human drivers, impacts, and responses to changes in weather and climate. The course uses perspectives from sociology, anthropology, and environmental justice to understand the challenges that people, communities, and nations are facing today and are likely to experience later in this century. Because climate change is a complex problem, we also draw upon research by historians, archaeologists, health geographers, and climate scientists. Students will apply their new knowledge to a final project on climate change in Boston.

				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>The video game industry is one of the largest sectors of the entertainment industry. But the importance of games goes well beyond industrial silos. Games and game mechanics are factoring into the experience of television, film and the web, and increasingly, into other institutions, including education, democracy and health. What’s more, games are being deployed in these contexts to produce real world social change. This class provides students with an introduction to games and game design and gives them the opportunity to partner with an organization in designing games for real people to solve real problems. Students will work in groups, each with a specific geographic and content focus, to design board (or otherwise analog) games and digital prototypes that will be tested and deployed.</p>

				<h1>Data Storytelling</h1>

					<h2>Instructor</h2>Rahul Bhargava 
				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This class is focused on how to tell stories with data to create social change. We will learn through case studies, examples and hands-on work with tools and technologies. We will introduce basic methods for research, cleaning and analyzing datasets, but the focus in on creative methods and media for data presentation and storytelling. We will consider the emotional, aesthetic and practical effects of different presentation methods as well as how to develop metrics for assessing impact. Over the course of the semester, students will work in small groups to create 5 sketches, each using a different technique for telling a data-driven story.  Think about a “sketch” as a half-realized project; where you have implemented just enough of the most important details of the idea in order for us to understand your vision.  A sketch is NOT a fully realized presentation of a data story. For the final project, students will have the chance to expand and expand on one of these sketches to create fully realized presentation of a data-driven story.

The course is open to all technical levels and backgrounds. We will prioritize students with a strong background in one or more of the following areas: journalism, software development, data analysis, documentary, visual and performing arts.</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This course serves as an introduction to contemporary and emergent design practice, by investigating the expanded role of design in the public realm, the agency of designers working with(in) communities, and the utility of design-thinking as a tool for social change. Students will learn in both lecture and project-based formats, and will be responsible for working cooperatively and collaboratively in teams on group projects. Students will engage in learning by doing, and they will be required to document, reflect, and analyze their work intermittently over the course of the semester and at the end of the semester through a formal Practice Assessment. Community Practice also provides an introduction to the Practice Department and the pedagogies of applied learning at the BAC.

				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>This course introduces concepts, methods and practices of data visualization and data storytelling for journalism and civic media graduate students. Data journalism is an emerging field of practice that ranges from the dazzling interactive graphics of the New York Times to the consistent, watchful reporting of sites like Homicide Watch. In this course, students learn to adopt a &quot;data-mindset&quot; and reflect on how telling stories with data can help advance (and occasionally obscure) public understanding. Students will learn how to find and create data sets for their stories, how to analyze data (including some basic scripting and coding) and how to present data in a variety of ways. We will also discuss privacy, verification, ethics and some of the other thorny issues that arise with data reporting. Some experience in HTML and coding is helpful but not required.

				<h2 style="padding-top:16px">Course Description</h2>
				<p>Nature, landscape, earth, environment, climate: so many words for the natural world that surrounds us. This class looks at the current state of the natural world: its beauty and peril, its sublime and polluted aspects. Projects will address the climate crisis through the lens of time. We will create projects that engage sustainability and resilience as creative responses in art and design to our imperiled future. Themes of energy, community, waste, conservation, interconnectedness, visual communication, and design for change will be our focus.
We will play with fundamental concepts of time in art including narrative, duration, tempo, and others through projects in a variety of media including sound, video, multiple image sequences, and books. Collaborative, research, and performative practices will be explored. The class will include a 4-5 week module creating civic media projects for and with Mothers Out Front, a national organization of mothers working to find solutions to climate issues, particularly around their key action agenda to halt new pipeline approvals in the Boston metro area, work with the gas companies to stop extensive gas leaks throughout the city, and spread information about the hazards of natural gas.</p>

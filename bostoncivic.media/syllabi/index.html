						<p>This seminar course based on lectures, collaborative class workshops, discussions and design exercises introduces students to an array of critical themes and concepts for the creative work at the intersection of digital systems data and physical objects and space – the emerging domain of what can be referred to as urban computing or ambient informatics.

Over the past years, much of our environment has been pervaded by networks and systems that generate digital bits as part of their operations (think of public transport electronic ticketing systems, telecommunication services, the electricity grid, logistic operations, etc.). Massive amounts of data are being generated by these systems at every instance and they are closely related to human activity, both informing human actions as well as reflecting their effects (for example, the digitization of the public transport system has enabled to inform passengers of the real-time location and arrival of busses as well as informing network operators and cities in real-time of the origin-destination patterns of all passengers at every instant).</p>

						<p>How can we make justice central in the stories we tell about urban landscapes? What role can critical landscape interpretation play in struggles for spatial justice? How can architecture generate more complex ways of thinking about and interacting with land and place while also expanding our political imagination? These questions animate and unify an interdisciplinary seminar that combines critical theory and spatial practice, and draws from a range of fields including history, geography, sociology, ethnic studies, architecture, planning, and environmental design.

Regarding critical landscape interpretation as a form of environmental design, we will consider the role of story and narrative in the social construction of space, and explore the relationships (and possible relationships) between spatial theory, history, and practice. The Los Angeles Urban Rangers—a collective of artists, historians, architects, and geographers—exemplify critical landscape interpretation. Appropriating the visual language and interpretive strategies of the National Park Service, the Rangers conduct fieldtrips (“Malibu Safaris” and “LA River Rambles”) that call attention to the complex political ecologies of the Los Angeles basin and empower residents to take a more active role in shaping the city. Bridging theory and practice, the Rangers articulate a vital role for critical landscape interpretation in prefiguring more socially and environmentally just worlds. Following the lead of the Rangers we will experiment with interpretive strategies in relation to the unique social and environmental histories, presents, and futures of the Boston metropolitan area and beyond.</p>

						<a href="/syllabus/race-space-and-nature"><h3 class="styled-title">Race, Space, And Nature</h3></a>
						<p>Drawing from environmental history, cultural geography, political ecology, and critical ethnic studies, this interdisciplinary graduate seminar explores the deep entanglements of race, space, and nature. Through a series of readings and discussions we will consider how historically specific concepts of race and nature “work together” (Moore et al.) to wield power and naturalize social hierarchies. We will also examine the geographical manifestations and material consequences of these evolving concepts. This seminar consists of two related parts. The first half of the semester will focus on race and space, particularly how processes of racial formation are entwined with the production of space, and also how the “visceral experience” of racism (Coates) is lived through space. George Lipsitz describes this nexus as “the spatialization of race and the racialization of space.” Readings include: Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me, Katherine McKittrick’s Demonic Grounds, Rashad Shabazz, Spatializing Blackness, and Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s Golden Gulag. The second half of the semester will focus on race and nature. We will consider how ideas about nature function vis- à-vis ongoing processes of racial formation and settler colonialism, and also how these ideas serve as the ontological foundation for claims about human difference. Essentialist ideas that invoke an external and universal nature depoliticize and dehistoricize what is in fact highly contested terrain. Environmental historian Donald Worster’s observation that the “Is of nature” often translates to the “Ought of man,” highlights the moral dimensions of nature as a concept. Focusing on the politics of nature, this seminar will identify the fields of power upon which this translation occurs in order to better appreciate how ideas about nature intersect with and amplify social differences, and also how the “Is of nature” marks certain bodies and places as polluted and others as pure. Readings include: Jake Kosek’s Understories, Carolyn Finney’s Black Faces, White Spaces, Mark Spence’s Dispossessing the Wilderness, and Lauret Savoy’s Trace.</p>

						<p>Native American Histories & Presence is an introduction to the Indigenous peoples of North America and to the academic field of Native American and Indigenous studies. Drawing from Indigenous studies, history, anthropology, cultural geography, settler colonial studies, and critical ethnic studies, this interdisciplinary course focuses on the resilience of Indian nations in New England and beyond. With an awareness of history’s bearing on the present and future, Native American Histories & Presence explores how treaties and the legacy of historical policies such as allotment, relocation, termination, boarding schools, and natural resource extraction impact tribal nations today. Regarding colonization and decolonization as ongoing processes, this course highlights concepts such as sovereignty, self-determination, and environmental justice within the context of enduring and evolving relationships to land and place. Native American Histories & Presence is structured around four intersecting themes: identity, land, law, and culture. The course culminates in a collaborative project that combines public history and public art in order to activate the landscape, engage new audiences, and propose new modes of just and peaceful coexistence in the colonial present.</p>

						<p>This course introduces concepts, methods and practices of data visualization and data storytelling for journalism majors. Data journalism is an emerging field of practice that ranges from the dazzling interactive graphics of the New York Times to the consistent, watchful reporting of sites like Homicide Watch. In this course, students learn to adopt a “data-mindset” and reflect on how telling stories with data can help advance (and occasionally obscure) public understanding. Students will learn how to find and create data sets for their stories, how to analyze data (including some basic scripting and coding) and how to present data in a variety of ways. We will also discuss privacy, verification, ethics and some of the other thorny issues that arise with data reporting. Some experience in HTML and coding is helpful but not required.</p>

						<p>Claims of the democratizing power of media are ubiquitous: from the Arab Spring to the Occupy movement, media (and in particular the internet) have been credited with the rebirth of democracy. Simultaneously, the relaxation of media ownership rules in the U.S., the degradation of journalism and newspapers, the increased pressures on profitability over high quality content pose questions about whether media’s impact has been entirely positive. These competing perspectives force us to ask, specifically: is media creating a thriving democracy or failing “idiocracy”? The goal of this course will be to consider what the ethical obligations of the media are in a democratic society and whether the media have met these obligations.</p>

						<p>This course centers on the changing relationships among digital texts and different domains of life–including personal, work, education, and public spheres. First, course readings and discussions focus on historical and theoretical aspects of digital culture: how do digital texts change the way we read, analyze, interpret, and compose? To address this question, students will study previous and current perspectives on the connections between literacy and technology. Second, coursework will require students to explore and develop their ability to analyze and compose digital texts; at the same time, students will practice thinking and writing critically about those texts. In all aspects of the course, students will explore how textuality is related to changes in media, and what those changes mean for personal, professional, and community life.</p>

We’ll read theories of how humans began to connect language and tools; we’ll read studies of the African Vai people, of school children, and of digital communities; we’ll look at how those studies understand the political, social, and ideological dimensions of different forms of meaning-making. Second, you’ll engage literacy by participating in a service-learning program that provides an opportunity to promote literate practice outside the classroom. As part of the course, you will choose a literacy program in the Boston area, volunteer as a writing tutor, coach, or teacher, and put into practice your developing understanding of what literacy means.</p>

Students will read, listen to, watch and discuss seminal works in the history of oral history—from Studs Terkel’s The Good War to award-winning radio documentaries and transmedia projects—which have sought to document and disseminate the stories of U.S. war veterans. Through discussions and reflective writing, students will take up challenging questions about narrative, representation, and the relationship between personal and public memory.

The course will provide students with an hands-on introduction to oral history methods—including preparing, recording, and transcribing interviews—as well as the craft of editing oral history materials into documentary narratives in textual and audio forms. Students will have the opportunity to share their own stories and to learn from the experiences of prominent local veterans through hands-on interviewing and storytelling projects, culminating in a collaborative public art initiative carried out in conjunction with the Congressional Medal of Honor Convention, to be held in Boston in September 2015.</p>

						<p>This course explores the process of collaborative video making with a focus on civic engagement and community media. A series of interactive hands-on labs that build analytical and technical skills will guide the development of micro-documentaries and short documentaries. Students will have the chance to work with local artists and community to produce videos that matter. The partnerships are coordinated through the award-winning center for Service-Learning at Northeastern University.

The course examines different forms of authorship, video genres and tools for collaborating ranging from crowdsourcing to remix platforms. While discussing pressing issues like poverty, racism and the environment, we will experiment with a variety of methods for effective collaboration and ethical participatory projects, and learn to pitch and promote video art projects in collaboration with organizations. The final projects will be presented during a public event for the wider Northeastern community and beyond.</p>

						<p>Space is not a container, but a product of human experience and practices. In this course, we will investigate how to read and represent public space, especially from a hearing perspective. Using the complex transitory spaces in and around South Station and Ruggles Station — their structures and flows, social practices, sensory and auditory qualities — the project is based on a thick mapping approach: an approach to cartographic representation that is not limited to the representation of a given data set, but also reflecting on the process of collecting these data. This joint studio between Architecture and Information Design and Visualization investigates different approaches to read and represent a complex informational environment, through observation, listening, and critical cartography. The studio incorporates methods from environment-behavior research, human geography, design research and sound studies.</p>

						<p>Social media networks, crowd sourcing, cell phone applications all allow us to see and understand cities and our role within them using a new lens. This workshop class will investigate the use of social media and digital technologies for planning and advocacy by working with actual planning and advocacy organizations to develop, implement, and evaluate prototype digital tools. Students will use the development of their digital tools as a way to investigate how new media technologies can be used for planning.
Student groups are paired with non-profit clients to develop a strategy for using social media and mobile technologies. Students are required to implement part of their strategy before the end of the class. They are also required to develop a method for how their “client” might incorporate these strategies into their own work processes. Students work with non-profits and learn how these two groups approach problems differently. The implementation phase teaches the students what works and what does not. This allows them to analyze how well their goals aligned with their strategies. Students learn the most from implementing their strategies as they discover how their theories apply to real world situations. The course will allow students to develop their own strategies for CROWD SOURCING THE CITY.</p>

						<p>We are swimming in data – “Big” and small, global and personal. And we are also facing complicated problems like Climate Change and inequality whose stories can only be told with data. The need for public understanding of data-driven issues is higher than ever before. But raw data doesn’t make a good story and that’s where you come in. This class is focused on how to tell stories with data to create social change. We will learn through case studies, examples and hands-on experimentation with tools and technologies. We will teach basic methods for research, cleaning and analysis of datasets as well as introduce creative methods of data presentation and storytelling. We will consider the emotional, aesthetic and practical effects of different presentation methods as well as how to develop metrics for assessing impact. For the final project, students will create a piece that tells a data-driven story.
The course is open to all technical levels and backgrounds. We will prioritize students with a strong background in one or more of the following areas: journalism, software development, data analysis, documentary, visual and performing arts.

This semester the course will have a special focus of Food Security. Most examples will use data related to this topic, homeworks will be related to it, and final projects must be connected to it as well.</p>

						<a href="/syllabus/solving-public-problems-using-technology"><h3 class="styled-title">Solving Public Problems Using Technology</h3></a>
						<p>Inside and outside government, technology has changed the way governance is perceived and delivered. Traditional good government advocates are pressing for more effective release and availability of government data so as to forward accountability and transparency. That same data can be used by entrepreneurs to launch private businesses that may or may not support public missions. Innovators within government are trying to find more efficient ways of both running government agencies and getting access to good ideas from outside the ranks of civil servants. Citizens increasingly want better, clearer access to government services. At the same time, core policy-makers are often uncomfortable with using technology to reveal and change how decisions are actually made within government. All of this is happening at local, national, and international levels, along with an explosion in the use of mobile communications and social media. But not everywhere: digital divides persist around the word. Technology is no longer something over which the IT department has unquestioned dominion (not that the IT department is going away). It is now part of every communications, operations, advocacy, and service-delivery strategy from both inside and outside government. However, strategic, directed, data-driven, outcomes-driven use of technology in governance is still very early in its development. Many governmental and NGO actors do not have the skills to use technology effectively, and talk about technology’s democracy-enhancing possibilities is often met with concern that technology will squelch public values rather than support them. This course will combine an overview of practical skills for using technology with analytical discussion, expert guest speakers, and an introduction to user-centered design. The course is designed to be at once an entry-level survey of the govtech landscape and a course on working with community partners to solve civic problems.</p>

						<p>This is a course on working with community partners to solve challenging civic problems. Through our combined efforts as the Community Innovation Lab, we will partner with the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics and three dynamic community organizations in the Dudley and Upham’s Corner neighborhoods of Boston. Our goal is to find innovative ways to enhance work that is already being done by our community partners in the area and/or propose creative and locally-appropriate means of supporting initiatives that the community identifies as important. Dudley Square is our focal point, but the proposals we make and the prototypes we imagine should be scalable beyond its borders. The course emphasizes creativity and collaboration with the goal of providing students with the tools they need to grapple with real-life urban and civic challenges postgraduation. The lab emphasizes user-centered design and the application of technology to civic problems. The lab defines technology expansively to mean the application of science, craft and art to the improvement of life. This naturally includes digital technology but also includes other areas of engagement, ranging from physical design to art practice. Furthermore, what constitutes technology is constantly being redefined based on its applicability to human needs.</p>

						<p>This course undertakes a detailed examination of international development in the context of global urbanization. It begins by introducing the historical context for urban growth in the developing world, examining in particular colonial policies towards urban settlements and urbanization. It then turns towards the challenge of defining international development, a task undertaken in part through a critical examination of key debates in development theory. The majority of the course concentrates on two main themes. In the first, it presents and evaluates the key policy frameworks and theoretical paradigms through which the challenges facing contemporary urban settlements in the developing world are understood and addressed. In the second, it focuses on an in-depth analysis of the principal substantive challenges facing developing world cities, ranging from rural/urban migration and the rapid growth of informal settlements to violence and urban health. The course makes a concerted point throughout of examining areas of overlap between developing and developed world experience, looking in particular at parallels between urban challenges in developing world cities and issues facing marginalized communities in North America and Europe.</p>

						<p>This workshop combines seminar and studio elements. In weekly seminar sessions, students discuss key readings on the theory and practice of participatory urban planning and design, drawing on both developed and developing world experience. In weekly studio sessions, students then tackle applied planning and design challenges facing marginalized Boston communities. The studio element of the course, which is referred to as the Community Innovation Lab, will be held in conjunction with the Kennedy School of Government’s DPI 682 (Solving Problems Using Technology) and in partnership with the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics. In small interdisciplinary teams, students from both courses will work with community partner organizations to solve pressing urban problems. The teams will bring together students with interests in planning, design, technology and policy. Seminar sessions will take place at the GSD and shared lab meetings will be held at the Harvard Innovation Lab on the Allston Campus. Recognizing that public participation plays a major role in urban planning, design and policy, the workshop seeks to provide students with a solid intellectual and professional foundation for work on participation-related issues. The seminar sessions serve as an opportunity to read and discuss cutting edge perspectives on participation that can inform the collaborative, applied work of the lab. The seminar will begin by looking at the history of participation and at different rationales for including the public in planning, design and policymaking. It will then examine the complexity of public participation in a wide variety of political, social and geographic settings. Major topics include the relationship between participation and project outcomes and the nature and scale of spillovers from participation to other aspects of social and political life. As a bridge to the lab sessions, the seminar will also examine key innovations in participation.

The iLab is located at 125 Western Avenue, on the Harvard Business School campus. looking at the role of new technologies and artistic practice in facilitating and shaping participation. The lab will be highly responsive to the needs of our local partners and students will gain hands-on experience working with, and responding to the needs of, marginalized communities. Student teams will be assigned to work with community organizations in Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood. Further information on the workshop’s community partners can be found in the “Partners” section of the syllabus. Together, students will work with these clients and the City of Boston to develop proposals that have the potential to improve living conditions and respond to urgent community needs. The specific design brief for the lab will emerge from our initial interaction with our community partners and be defined by their needs and the resources made available through the City of Boston and other partners. The course’s partnership with local community groups and the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics is meant to provide students with access to the actors central to urban planning in Boston and increase the likelihood that the proposals developed will be implemented following the course. To help ensure that this happens, the city has hired a facilitator who will work with the course and help to turn the course’s innovations into reality. The workshop is relevant for students who intend to go on to professional work involving public participation, including as urban planners, urban policymakers, designers, architects and landscape architects. It is also relevant to students who are undertaking graduate level research on participation issues.</p>

						<p>What makes someone a good citizen in a diverse democracy? Do good citizens: vote; protest; recite how a bill becomes a law; tolerate intolerance; work hard to support their families; feel patriotic; lead revolutions; run for political office; fight the power; join the army; volunteer; blog; all or none of the above? How should schools answer this question, and what are the implications of the answers they give? What empirical evidence is there for schools’ abilities to take on these issues? And how do individuals’ ethnoracial, cultural, religious, and gendered identities fit into the theory and practice of civic education in a diverse society? This course will address these and related issues through readings in political philosophy, political science, sociology, history, and psychology. We will also examine contemporary educational practices and resources such as state standards, after school and community programs, and civics textbooks. Topics to be covered include the contested aims of civic education; the civic empowerment gap; how education affects the quantity, quality, and equality of civic engagement; immigrant incorporation; African American traditions of civic education; patriotic education; identity formation; and civic and multicultural education for social transformation. Students will be encouraged to explore their own interests throughout the course by means of seminar leadership, two short papers, and a final project. All students will be encouraged to hone their analytic reading, discussion, and writing skills; these will be scaffolded throughout the semester in a respectful, supportive, and democratic context.</p>

						<p>This multi-disciplinary course uses Boston to help student better appreciate, understand and participate in contemporary urban life. In particular, we will explore three central questions at the heart of any conversation about any city. Who is Boston for? Who should it be for? And how will those decisions get made? The course will examine these questions via a unique combination of readings, lectures, presentations by notable local practitioners, visits to different parts of Boston, and writing assignments. In that work, we take seriously that studying a city – and teaching a Gen Ed course – is an exercise in dissonance, plurality, and negotiation. To that end, this course draws on a wide number of sources and disciplines to help answer three fundamental questions, which are always making demands of each other.</p>

						<p>The contemporary city is constituted by multiple overlapping, intermixing realities articulated across built form and imagined space, individual experience and collective memory, embodied sensation and digital mediation.
Often, these multiple realities are invisible or illegible, with certain narratives dominating particular environments. However, realities always leave traces, to be excavated and reconstructed. The Mixed­Reality City is an exploratory research seminar and workshop in which students pursue studies of urbanism­in­the­making through means and methods emerging in the digital arts and humanities, including: data narrative, digital ethnography, adversarial design, and critical technical practice. The course focuses in equal parts on unpacking discourses and developing interpretative digital artifacts.

For Spring 2015, Mixed­Reality City takes on transit as a heuristic for understanding and experiencing the city, and travel as a means of performing urban space. We’ll proceed through five modules, touring dominant modes of moving through urban spaces, surveying their alternative and corollary modalities along the way.</p>

						<p>Cultural Agents can be considered a response to the question, “Why the Humanities?” In this course, we study Aesthetics as a mainstay of the Humanities which partners with all fields of study and professional practice (medicine, politics, business, law, education, among others). In collaboration with speakers from a variety of fields, we will examine the writings of several theorists who engage aesthetics. We explore arts and interpretation to develop useful concepts (point of view, technique, context, competing messages, aesthetic effects). Part of the work is to train free, disinterested judgment. This faculty for pausing to step back and take stock is basic to all disciplines. That’s why humanistic training is a fundamental contribution to general research and to social development. Interpreting art, appreciating its power to shape the world, can spur and support urgently needed change. This is not a deviation from humanistic attention to the mechanisms of art production and reception. It is a corollary and a homecoming to civic education.</p>
